# IAM JML Lab

This folder provides a high level overview of the Joiner Mover Leaver lab.

The goal is to demonstrate basic IAM lifecycle thinking using Active Directory.
This lab demonstrates a Joiner, Mover, and Leaver lifecycle implemented in Active Directory using role based access control.

Key points:
- Users are assigned to role groups only
- Role groups are nested into application access groups
- Access changes are driven by lifecycle events, not manual app assignments
